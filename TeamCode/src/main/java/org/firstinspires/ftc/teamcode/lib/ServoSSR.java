/*
Usage
=====

Instantiate with a Servo interface instance:
	ServoSSR servoWhatever;
	servoWhatever = new ServoSSR(parts.robot.servo0);   -or similar-
	servoWhatever = new ServoSSR(hardwareMap.get(Servo.class,"servo0"));

For convenience, the new settings can be chained:
    servoWhatever.setSweepTime(1000).setWakeTime(250).setOffset(-0.05).setFullPwmRange()

All of the ordinary Servo methods and properties are available with the following changes and additions:

setPosition() - sets the position with offset and calculates the expected movement time
setOffset(offset) - set an offset that will be added to positions (for tuning a replacement servo or one of a pair acting together)
setScale(scale) - set a scale multiplier for positions
setSweepTime(sweepTime) - set the time expected for the servo to move its entire range
setSweepTime(sweepTimeTo1, sweepTimeTo0) - set the bi-directional time expected for the servo to move its entire range
setSweepSpeed(speed, fullRangeAngle, loadFactor) - set the servo sweep speed based on published servo specifications
setWakeTime(wakeTime) - set the time expected for the servo to move back to its position after being disabled
setFullPwmRange() - sets the controller to use pwm range of 500-2500 μs vs. the default of 600-2400 μs
setPwmRange(low, high) - sets the controller to use an arbitrary pwm range
resetTime(delay) - resets the internal timer to delay or default of sweepTime
stop() - disables the servo pwm signal and its position will be unknown/unpredictable (e.g., emergency stop)
disable() - disables the servo pwm signal and assumes it will stay near its last position (e.g., docked or parked)
enable() - enables the servo pwm signal (not usually necessary to do manually)
getOffset() - returns the offset value
getPositionWithOffset() - returns the position set (subtracting the offset, so back to the original position vs. the offset position)
isDone() - is the servo done moving? (servo is enabled, timer is complete)
isTimerDone() - is the servo timer done? (does not account for the possibility that the servo has been disabled)
timeRemaining() - returns the time remaining before the servo is expected to have finished moving
isAtPosition(comparePosition) - is the servo done moving, and is the position this position?
isSetPosition(comparePosition) - is the servo set to this position? (may still be moving)
isEnabled() - is the servo enabled?
isDisabled() - is the servo disabled?
isStopped() - is the servo stopped?
isUnknown() - is the servo position unknown (due to .stop or pwm changes outside of this class)?
getServo() - get the servo object for whatever reason
setDirectionSSR(direction) - Set the direction; like .setDirection but can be chained with other methods
setPower(power) - sets the "power" like a CRservo, -1 to 1.
getPower() - returns the "power", -1 to 1.
setBlinkinPattern(pattern) - sets using pattern as int or RevBlinkinLedDriver.BlinkinPattern; must use setFullPwmRange()
